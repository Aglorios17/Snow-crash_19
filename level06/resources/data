# TODO
create a file to sent to level06 php executable in tmp

test :
sent [x {hello.world}] => {hello x world}

debug_info : 
- argv2 not use
- [x ..] to cal first function function x($y, $z)
- {${`getflag`}} use in function y($m) return with no change to file_get_contents

risk :
The /e modifier evaluates the replacement as PHP code, which can be a security risk if the input is not properly validated or sanitized.
$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);

If an attacker can control the input file or the second argument passed to the script ($argv[2]), they could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code within the y() function.
This can lead to unauthorized code execution and pose a security risk.
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user input before using it in such dynamic evaluation scenarios.
You should carefully review and validate any input before passing it to functions like preg_replace with the /e modifier or executing it as code.
It is generally recommended to use alternative approaches,
such as using preg_replace_callback with a custom callback function, to achieve the desired functionality without introducing potential code injection vulnerabilities.
